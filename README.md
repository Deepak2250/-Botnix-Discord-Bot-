API Reference:

The Anime News Discord Bot relies on the Jikan API for retrieving anime-related information, including news updates, series details, and more.

Jikan API: The Jikan API is an open-source RESTful API for accessing MyAnimeList.net's vast database of anime and manga information. It provides endpoints for retrieving information about anime, manga, characters, episodes, and more. The API is free to use and does not require authentication. For more information and documentation, visit the Jikan API documentation.
Usage:

To use the Jikan API with the Anime News Discord Bot, you can make HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints provided by the Jikan API. You can retrieve anime details, search for anime by title, fetch information about specific characters or episodes, and more. Refer to the Jikan API documentation for detailed usage instructions and available endpoints.


GET https://api.jikan.moe/v3/anime/{anime_id}

Replace {anime_id} with the ID of the anime you want to retrieve information about. This endpoint will return detailed information about the specified anime, including its title, synopsis, genres, airing status, and more.

Feel free to customize this API reference section to include additional details or specific usage instructions relevant to your Discord bot and its integration with the Jikan API. Let me know if you need further assistance!
